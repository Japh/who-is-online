##Description

This is the finished product of an example plug-in demonsrated in an upcoming series on the new Heartbeat API at [wp.tuts+](http://wp.tutsplus.com/).

Please note that this plug-in requries **WordPress 3.6 RC1+**. It is intended only as an example of the Heartbeat API in a plug-in.

The plug-in uses the jQuery add-on, [jQuery Notices](https://code.google.com/p/jquery-notice/) by Tim Benniks.
